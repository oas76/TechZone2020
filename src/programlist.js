        <description>Cameras with digital pan, tilt and zoom have come to play ann important role in our product portfolio. Combined with the trend of wide-angle lenses, correct handling of lens distortion and digital perspective correction becomes increasingly important.
The presentation will start with a theoretical background and finish with a real-time demo of how these aspects affect the end user experience.</description>

        <description>The Blåmandag team is implementing historic Workspace Metrics to enable customers to analyse their Workspace environment using sensor data from our devices (temperature, humidity, utilisation using people count and more). To store this data from hundreds of thousands of devices, we need a scalable time series data store that easily deals with millions of measurements with a long retention. In this talk we look at Amazon Timestream; a fast, scalable, managed time series database service.</description>

        <description>AV1 is a royalty-free video codec released in 2018 by the Alliance for Open Media.  Since its release we've worked hard on a software implementation for our own products.  We'll show that AV1, contrary to popular belief, is suitable for real-time encoding on modest CPU's and even outperforming H.265.</description>

        <description>We all have biases that impact what we say and how we say it. The mismatch between what users say they need - and what they really need - can therefore lead us astray when identifying which features and products to build next. This presentation is a basic introduction to industry standard approaches adapted from social sciences to minimize this problem; a field called User Experience (UX) research.</description>

        <description>Proximity service is using 81bit ultrasound tokens and readable 9 character codes to connect devices. With that limited space to encode cluster information we had to ensure using as little space as possible, in addition to hiding it in the readable codes.

        <description>During the ramp-up in the early days of covid-19, there was a need to quickly reduce the load and bandwidth usage on the Webex servers, both for audio and video. For CE audio, one of these actions was to support 40ms rtp packet sizes for Opus. This talk touches what decisions and work we needed to do to make it work in a best possible way.</description>

        <description>Through a simple pair-programming demo we will try to show how Test Driven Development builds quality into the sw.
By having a lot of small and brutally simple low-level tests, developers can get quick and easy-to-understand feedback from automated tests before potential bugs are committed. This may help reduce the time from code is committed to it can be deployed.</description>

It has previously been a very tedious process and that’s nothing software engineers like to do. Now the biggest burden of this is handled by tools and services in Cisco. I will briefly take a tour of the process and why this is very important to Cisco. Lots of dangers if we fall short on this!</description>

        <description>Often a service or system is designed tailored to solve a specific problem, but sometimes it’s worthwhile to instead develop a framework or a platform that can solve a more general problem.
When we were tasked to help with configuration of our rapidly evolving Webex devices, we did not want the cloud to be the bottleneck for new device features being released. We therefore designed a platform that can be used to configure any device, not just the ones we make in Lysaker. The device software is in charge of describing what it can configure and how, we dynamically generate APIs and UI that will adapt to what the device tells us it needs. Any new device software release or even new device will just upload a schema describing its new configurations and it will immediately be available to administrators to start using, without the need to do any changes in the configuration platform.</description>

        <description>GOT RELATIONSHIP PROBLEMS?
Well, we got solutions. Or at least ideas. OK, we should probably just say we’ve got ideas for solutions, because God knows we can't fix everybody's shit.
In this talk we highlight some of our processes and how we have adapted them to the current home office situation.
We will cover how we ensure everybody is heard by doing democratic meetings, how we use a video "vindu" to have the feeling of working in the same room and to be social also between meetings, how we pair/mob program and design our solutions together as a group, and how we demo the things we’ve done and celebrate our successes. We will also talk about how we put in practice one of the core principles of the Oslo Cloud team: "don’t be an ass".</description>

The TDE group has continuously improved the automation in our production line and put a lot of effort in standardising and stream lining our test solution. We will present the current status of the room kit production line and show how we are planning the next major automation step. </description>

        <description>Running a webengine like Chromium on an embedded device contains both the security concerns of running it on your desktop computer, and a couple more.
In this talk we will go through what type of concerns Chromium creates, what we have done to mitigate those concerns, and what we can do to lock it down even further. We will also talk about what issues we ran into that are specific to our architecture, where Chromium have to run as an Android application.</description>

What is it with the thing called XAPI that has made it stay relevant for so many years?
This talk will cover the historic evolvement of the XAPI and discuss keys to its success. And BTW, where did the “X” come from...?</description>

        <description>Ultrasound-emitting devices are used widely in public. Regulations on safe exposure levels lag research in the fields of audiometry and psychoacoustics.
20 adults with no history of hearing problems were tested under free-field conditions. Participant feedback suggests that the perception of stimuli shifts from hearing to feeling at higher frequencies..</description>

        <description>At TechZone two years ago, we presented an idea for connecting CUCM-registered devices to the Webex cloud. Since then, we've GA'd the new deployment model, and have onboarded over 10.000 devices to the program. Let's take a look at what's available now, what's coming soon, and what this can mean for RoomOS development moving forward.</description>

        <description>New times call for new solutions. Our video devices contain an amazing collection of tools and APIs that can be used to tweak you device to the unrecognisable, and in your home office you should use that for all its worth.
Come see a freak show gallery of hacks, such as home screen widget dashboard, child safe call controls, daily updated photo wallpapers, senior-friendly call UI, super sonic ring tones for the hearing impaired and more. If you have a hacker inside but haven't looked at macros, in-room controls or web apps yet, this talk is for you.</description>
